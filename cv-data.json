  "careerSummary": "Hello! My name is Andrej and I am a pragmatic programmer/engineer with a strong passion for software architecture. More than fifteen years of experience working on different projects and technologies with different teams from all around the world gives me enough confidence to claim that I can tackle any technical challenge (in a rational time frame of course :) ), but also the awareness that I need to learn and contribute more. I have a masterâ€™s degree in software engineering and a strong background in product development, maintenance, publishing and monitoring, for industries like healthcare, leisure, travel & tourism, communications, e-commerce, etc. My main development experience until now was mostly designing and implementing scalable Web Applications and APIs using C#, AWS, Azure, SQL, NoSQL, and various UI JavaScript frameworks. Besides Web, I have also worked with wide variety of other languages and technologies oriented to developing phone or desktop applications, like WPF, Unity, Python etc. Overall, a passionate techie team player who likes diversity, discipline and good developer habits.",
